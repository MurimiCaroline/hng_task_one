# hng_task_one

This is my first submission of the hng internship task one.

I have assumed that the app will run on an android device.

My environment has Flutter  version 3.13.2 and Dart version 3.1.0.

I have set the minimum SDK version to 19.

To run the app, you can clone this repository and use an android emulator to visualize.

I have also assumed that the Github navigation bar is failing to be responsive due to an error that I cannot handle on my end. I have wrapped the WebView with a container that takes up the 
whole width but the Github Navigation bar remains unreponsive.
